 * Beta build flag, read from `app.json` -> `expo.extra.beta.enabled`.

 * A beta build grants every premium feature for free and never offers a
 * purchase: no store is contacted, no price is shown and no transaction can be
 * started. The RevenueCat implementation in `src/billing/` is untouched, so
 * setting this flag back to `false` restores the normal production monetization
 * path (RevenueCat key + Google Play products) with no code change.
 *
 * The default argument is the app config the `expo-constants` gradle script
 * embeds into the APK on every build, so the flag is baked in at build time.
 * Passing the config explicitly keeps this a pure, testable read.

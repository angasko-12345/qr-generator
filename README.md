# QR Generator

A production-ready Android QR code generator built with Expo (React Native + TypeScript).

Generates QR codes from plain text, URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, and Wi-Fi
credentials. Live preview, PNG export, share, copy, dark mode, saved codes, history,
and a premium tier sold through Google Play: Monthly Pro and Yearly Pro
subscriptions plus a Lifetime Pro one-time purchase, unified behind a single
RevenueCat `premium` entitlement.

Everything runs on-device. No accounts, no backend, no analytics, no ads. The
free tier never requires a purchase.

## Features

- 5 input types: Text, URL, Email, Phone, Wi-Fi (with security, hidden SSID, and
  network type options)
- Large live QR preview; the code updates as you type
- Save as PNG (Android Storage Access Framework folder picker), system share sheet,
  copy image to clipboard, clear/reset
- Dark, light, and system theme with persistence
- Free tier: basic generation, PNG export, sharing, 3 saved codes, square style
- Premium tier (entitlement-gated): custom QR/background colors, rounded and dot
  styles, logo overlay, unlimited saves, history
- Premium purchases through Google Play Billing + RevenueCat: Monthly Pro,
  Yearly Pro (highlighted "Best value"), Lifetime Pro (one-time), real localized
  store prices, restore purchases, pending/failure/expiry handling; all three
  plans unlock the same `premium` entitlement
- Honest "purchases are not connected in this build" state until the store
  setup in `BILLING_SETUP.md` is completed; purchases are never faked
- Saved codes, history, and settings stored locally (AsyncStorage), capped and
  deduplicated
- Accessible labels/roles on all controls, Android back closes sheets, works offline
- Free beta mode (`expo.extra.beta.enabled`): premium unlocked for testers,
  purchases switched off, built locally as an APK: see `BETA.md`

```

Pure QR/content/entitlement logic lives in leaf modules (`src/qr`, `src/premium`)
with unit tests and no platform I/O.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- For EAS cloud builds: a free Expo account (`https://expo.dev/signup`)
- For local builds: JDK 17+ (keytool), Android SDK (platform 36, build-tools 36.0.0)

## Commands

### Install and develop

```bash
npm install
npx expo start                # dev server; scan QR with Expo Go
npx expo start --web          # browser preview (development only)
```

### Quality gates

```bash
npm run typecheck             # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint                  # eslint .
npm test                      # jest unit tests
```

### Build the production .aab with EAS (recommended)

EAS signs the bundle with credentials stored in your Expo account, so nothing
sensitive lives in this repository.

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login                     # or: export EXPO_TOKEN=... for CI
eas build:configure           # once; eas.json already present in this repo
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

The build runs in the cloud and finishes with a downloadable
**`app-release.aab`** (Android App Bundle). The command prints the download URL;
`eas build:list` shows past builds.

Signing (one-time, per Expo account):

```bash
eas credentials
# Android -> com.qrgenerator.app -> Production -> Upload new keystore
#   (or let EAS generate one when prompted on first build)
```

If you use EAS-generated keys, register the resulting upload key in Google Play
(Play Console -> App integrity -> App signing) when first uploading.

### Build the .aab locally (verification without EAS)

```bash
npx expo prebuild -p android --no-install     # generates android/ (gitignored)
bash scripts/setup_signing.sh                 # creates local keystore, prompts twice
# non-interactive: SIGNING_STORE_PASS=... SIGNING_KEY_PASS=... bash scripts/setup_signing.sh

cd android
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android-sdk
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-17-or-newer
./gradlew bundleRelease                       # Windows: gradlew.bat bundleRelease
```

Output:

```
android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Notes:

- `setup_signing.sh` writes `android/app/release-qr.jks` and
  `android/keystore.properties`; everything under `android/` is gitignored, so no
  keys or passwords are ever committed. It also patches the generated
  `android/app/build.gradle` to read that properties file (marker:
  `QRGEN-LOCAL-SIGNING`); re-run it after any `expo prebuild --clean`.
- On Windows, if the Hermes compiler fails with "permission denied" under the
  system temp directory, point TEMP/TMP at a writable folder first:
  `set TEMP=%CD%\..\.tmp` (from `android/`), same for `TMP`.

### Build the free beta APK (local, no AAB, no cloud)

```bash
# android/ must exist (see the local .aab section above for prebuild/signing)
cd android
export ANDROID_HOME=/path/to/android-sdk
CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2 sh gradlew --max-workers=3 -Dorg.gradle.parallel=false :app:assembleRelease
```

Output (an installable APK, not an AAB):

```
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

Set `expo.extra.beta.enabled` in `app.json` first: it unlocks premium for
testers and disables every purchase flow. Full details, install steps and
GitHub Releases distribution are in `BETA.md`.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Needed for | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EXPO_TOKEN` | CI / scripted EAS builds | Expo authentication (`eas whoami` to verify) |
| `ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` | local Gradle build | Android SDK location |
| `JAVA_HOME` | local Gradle build | JDK 17+ used by Gradle and keytool |
| `TEMP` / `TMP` | local Windows build | writable temp dir for the Hermes compiler |
| `SIGNING_STORE_PASS`, `SIGNING_KEY_PASS` | non-interactive `setup_signing.sh` | keystore passwords (never commit values) |

No secret keys are stored in this repository.

## Publishing to Google Play (manual steps)

1. `eas build --platform android --profile production` and download
   `app-release.aab`.
2. In Google Play Console create the app (QR Generator, package
   `com.qrgenerator.app`) with default language and free pricing.
3. App integrity: register the upload key EAS shows (or enable Play App Signing
   and upload the upload key when prompted).
4. Upload the `.aab` to a track (start with Internal testing, then Production).
5. Store listing: title, description, category (Tools/Utilities), screenshots
   (phone), feature graphic, app icon.
6. Content rating questionnaire and Data safety form: this app collects nothing
   and stores all content on-device; answer accordingly.
7. Privacy policy: host `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` at a public URL and paste the link in
   the Play Console (App content -> Privacy policy).
8. Target API level declaration: the app targets API 36, which satisfies the
   current Play requirement.
9. Premium billing: follow `BILLING_SETUP.md`. The app code (RevenueCat SDK,
   `premium` entitlement, three purchase options, restore) is wired; you must
   still create the Play products/base plans, the RevenueCat project/entitlement/
   offering, and add the `goog_` public SDK key to `app.json`, then rebuild.
   Unconfigured builds show an honest "not connected" notice instead of prices.

Set a real contact email in `PRIVACY_POLICY.md` before publishing.

## Development notes

- `plugins/withBillingLaunchMode.js` sets `android:launchMode="singleTop"` on
  MainActivity; `expo prebuild` applies it. RevenueCat's docs: the default
  `singleTask` launch mode can cancel a purchase when Android recreates the app
  behind the Google Play payment sheet. The app has no deep-link listeners, so
  `singleTop` is safe and required for reliable purchases.
- `app.json` blocks unnecessary permissions; the manifest ships with `INTERNET`
  only (plus explicit removals for storage/audio/overlay permissions some Expo
  templates add). Billing uses the `com.android.vending.BILLING` permission
  added by `react-native-purchases`.
- Debug tooling (dev menu, Metro, LogBox overlays) does not appear in release
  bundles; release builds do not depend on Expo Go.
- To regenerate app assets: `python scripts/generate_assets.py` (Pillow).
